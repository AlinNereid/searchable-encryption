Lab2:
	* Useful links
	* State of the art
Lab3:
	* Requirement Analysis (with Butnaru Alin Silviu)
		- Application limits
		- Potential clients
		- Requirements
		- Actors
		- System components
	* Component diagram (component1.png) and class diagram for IBE-based searchable encryption (class_ibe.png)
Lab4:
	* Design patterns for the IBE searchable encryption module.
	* Iterator design pattern for UserData class.
	* AbstractFactory design pattern for encrypted databases.
Lab5:
	* BPMN for search query.
	* Two iterations of TDD for IBE searchable encryption:
		- IBE/Core/UserData class;
		- IBE/Core/Token class.
Lab6:
	* Full implementation for some classes used in IBE encryption:
		- IBE/core/UserData.java
		- IBE/core/UserDayaIterator.java
		- IBE/core/Token.java
	* Aspect IBE/aspects/TokenDataAspect.aj to monitor how many bytes are set in all the Token objects across the application.
