Lab2:
	useful links
	searchable symmetric key encryption
Lab3:
	establish the limits of application + potential clients (with George)
	use case scenarios (1-4)
	class diagram and sequence diagram for SSKE and class diagram users/wordsDAO
Lab4:
	Interator pattern on EncryptedWords.
	Decorator pattern on SSKEKEYS.
	Generate code with EMF.
Lab5:
	Implement AES, PRF and PRG
	TDD for SSKE (AES, PRF, PRG and SSKE)
	BPMN for search query.
Lab6-Lab7:
	Implement SSKE (encrypt, decrypt and search)
	Wrote aspects for: caching the encryption, write in the console which word is encrypted/decrypted and the keys used.
	Also wrote an aspect which calculates the time needed to do a search.
